Neural networks that are able to reliably execute algorithmic computation may hold transformative potential to both machine learning and theoretical computer science. On one hand, they could enable the kind of extrapolative generalisation scarcely seen with deep learning models. On another, they may allow for running classical algorithms on inputs previously considered inaccessible to them.

Both of these promises are shepherded by the neural algorithmic reasoning blueprint, which has been recently proposed in a [position paper](https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(21)00099-4.pdf) by Petar Veličković and Charles Blundell. On paper, this is a remarkably elegant pipeline for reasoning on natural inputs which carefully leverages the tried-and-tested power of deep neural networks as feature extractors. In practice, how far did we actually take it?

In this tutorial, we aim to provide the foundations needed to answer three key questions of neural algorithmic reasoning: how to _develop_ neural networks that execute algorithmic computation, how to _deploy_ such neural networks in real-world problems, and how to _deepen_ their theoretical links to classical algorithms.

Our tutorial will be presented from the ground up, in a way that is accessible to anyone with a basic computer science background. Hands-on coding segments will also be provided, showing how attendees can directly develop their ideas in graph representation learning on relevant algorithmic reasoning datasets (such as [CLRS-30](https://github.com/deepmind/clrs)), and then deploy them in downstream agents (e.g., in [reinforcement learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/82e9e7a12665240d13d0b928be28f230-Abstract.html)).

The key outcome of our neural algorithmic reasoning tutorial will be to introduce the vibrant LoG audience to this emerging field (which is also within LoG's highlighted topic areas). Specifically, we aim for our tutorial's attendees to come away with the following takeaways:

* Understand why it is a good idea to build neural networks that model algorithmic computation;
* Cover theoretical underpinnings of neural algorithmic reasoning, such as algorithmic alignment;
* Follow hands-on examples on how to develop algorithmically-aligned GNNs on relevant datasets;
* Concretise the neural algorithmic reasoning blueprint by deploying such a GNN in an RL agent;
* Appreciate using emerging techniques (e.g. Category Theory) to build potent algorithmic GNNs.
