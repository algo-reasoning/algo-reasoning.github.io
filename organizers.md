[**Petar Veličković**](https://petar-v.com) is a Staff Research Scientist at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/), Affiliated Lecturer at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), and an Associate of [Clare Hall, Cambridge](https://www.clarehall.cam.ac.uk/). Petar's research concerns [geometric deep learning](https://geometricdeeplearning.com/)---devising neural network architectures that respect the invariances and symmetries in data (a topic he's co-written a [proto-book](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.13478) about). Within this area, Petar focusses on [graph representation learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Bc8GiEZkTe5) and its applications in [neural algorithmic reasoning](https://www.cell.com/patterns/pdf/S2666-3899(21)00099-4.pdf). Petar's research has been used in [substantially improving the travel-time predictions](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/traffic-prediction-with-advanced-graph-neural-networks) in [Google Maps](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-101-how-ai-helps-predict-traffic-and-determine-routes/), and [guiding the intuition of mathematicians](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04086-x) towards new top-tier [theorems and conjectures](https://www.ams.org/journals/ert/2022-26-37/S1088-4165-2022-00624-8/). _Petar has published several first-author papers in the area of neural algorithmic reasoning at top-tier venues ([ICLR'20](https://openreview.net/forum?id=SkgKO0EtvS), [NeurIPS'20 spotlight](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/hash/176bf6219855a6eb1f3a30903e34b6fb-Abstract.html), [ICML'22](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v162/velickovic22a.html), [NeurIPS'22](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wu1Za9dY1GY)), including the [CLRS-30 benchmark](https://github.com/deepmind/clrs), which is the first general-purpose unified algorithmic reasoning benchmark._

[**Andreea Deac**](https://andreeadeac22.github.io/) is a PhD student at [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/en/) and [Mila](https://mila.quebec/), supervised by [Jian Tang](https://jian-tang.com/). Andreea is broadly interested in how learning can be improved through the use of graph representations, having worked on neural algorithmic reasoning, [reinforcement learning](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/82e9e7a12665240d13d0b928be28f230-Abstract.html) and [applications to biotechnology](https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/cmb.2018.0175), in particular [drug discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.00534). During her PhD, Andreea spent time at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/), working with [Doina Precup](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~dprecup/), [Théophane Weber](http://thphn.com/) and [George Papamakarios](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=wHcpf58AAAAJ&hl=en), and at [MSR Cambridge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/), working with [Marc Brockschmidt](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=pF27eLMAAAAJ&hl=en). Prior to that, Andreea completed her MEng with distinction under the supervision of [Pietro Liò](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pl219/) at [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/). _Andreea has published several key contributions to neural algorithmic reasoning and its deployments in downstream tasks, including the [eXecuted Latent Value Iteration Network](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2021/hash/82e9e7a12665240d13d0b928be28f230-Abstract.html) (XLVIN, NeurIPS'21 spotlight), which is the first published evidence of downstream utility of neural algorithmic reasoning._

[**Andrew Dudzik**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=DdFjaEEAAAAJ) is a Senior Research Engineer at [DeepMind](https://www.deepmind.com/) working on [theoretical foundations of algorithmic alignment and GNNs](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wu1Za9dY1GY), and making things run fast.  Before that, he was fifth author on the [AlphaStar](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1724-z) paper, working in diverse areas like multi-agent and architecture innovation, as well as scaling and resource management.  Before that, he got his PhD at [U.C. Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) in [hyperalgebra and algebraic geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09227).  And before that, he worked in finance, search, and even as an Agile software consultant. _Andrew has published a joint-first-author paper on the [categorical foundations of algorithmic reasoning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=wu1Za9dY1GY) (NeurIPS'22), which is the first paper attempting to thoroughly ground the principles of algorithmic alignment._
