**Submission deadline:** Thursday, 12 September 2019 (23:59 AoE)

**Author notification:** October 1st

**Camera ready deadline:** October 14th (23:59 AoE)

**Workshop:** Friday, 13 December 2019, Vancouver Convention Center, Hall A

You may submit your paper through **CMT**, by following [this link](https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/NeurIPSGRL2019/).

We encourage submissions to our workshop on topics related to representation learning on graph-structured data. We will especially appreciate submissions that connect directly with the topic of the workshop, as well as papers that introduce relevant benchmark datasets, challenges and competitions.

Submissions should be extended abstracts of no more than 4 pages (not including references or supplementary materials). We request and recommend that authors rely on the supplementary material only to include minor details (e.g., hyperparameter settings) that do not fit in the 4 pages.

In addition, we also welcome 1-page submissions describing open problems and challenges in the domain of graph representation learning. 

All submissions must use the [**NeurIPS template**](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2019/PaperInformation/StyleFiles). 
Submissions should be in `.pdf` format, and the review process is **double-blind**---therefore the papers should be appropriately anonymised. Previously published work (or under-review) is acceptable. 

Accepted work will be presented as posters during the workshop and listed on this website. Additionally, a small number of papers will be selected to be presented as spotlight talks during the workshop.
